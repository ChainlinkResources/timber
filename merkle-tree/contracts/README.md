# Example Contracts

These contracts are provided to demonstrate deploying the merkle-tree contracts from this merkle-tree microservice.

To deploy from this merkle-tree microservice, the `DEPLOYMENT_LOCALITY` environment variable needs to be set to `DEPLOYMENT_LOCALITY = 'local'` in the `docker-compose.yml` file.

The contracts will then be deployed when the microservice is started with `docker-compose up`.
